## <a href="#howcontrib" name="howcontrib">#</a> How to contribute

<a href="#git" name="git">#</a> __If you like git__

1. Fork <https://github.com/sckott/rforcats> to your account
2. Clone down to your machine from your account
3. Add an upstream remote for the `sckott/rforcats` repo by doing `git remote add upstream git@github.com:sckott/rforcats.git`
4. Make a new feature branch
5. The only file to change is `index.Rmd`. It's a R markdown document, which is essentially just Markdown, so should be easy to add to/change. After you make your changes, run `knit("index.Rmd")` in R, which will build a new `index.md`. If you have time/interest, also build the html page by doing `jekyll build`. This requires [`jekyll`](https://jekyllrb.com/) of course. You can also preview the site by doing `jekyll serve`, then navigate in your browser to <http://localhost:4000>
6. Commit those changes and push to your account
7. Send a pull request to `sckott/rforcats`



<a href="#gitlessr" name="gitlessr">#</a> __If you like git, but aren't that familiar with R__

1. Fork <https://github.com/sckott/rforcats> to your account
2. Clone down to your machine from your account
3. Add an upstream remote for the `sckott/rforcats` repo by doing `git remote add upstream git@github.com:sckott/rforcats.git`
4. Make a new feature branch
5. The only file to change is `index.Rmd`. It's a R markdown document, which is essentially just Markdown, so should be easy to add to/change.

<a href="#nogit" name="nogit">#</a> __If you don't like git (or, _I don't know what git is_)__

1. Go to the [index.Rmd file](https://github.com/sckott/rforcats/blob/gh-pages/index.Rmd) in the `rforcats` GitHub repository
2. Edit whatever you want
3. Then write a message in the box at the bottom, and press the green button _Propose file change_. This will make a fork of the repo to your github account. You then can write any other message you want and press another green button _Send pull request_
4. The end!


<a href="#issue" name="issue">#</a> __Issues/bugs/questions/feature requests__

If you want to submit an issue (bug report/question/feature request/etc.), go to the [issues page](https://github.com/sckott/rforcats/issues?state=open) and do that.

Thanks for contributing whether you or your cat wrote the code!!!!!
